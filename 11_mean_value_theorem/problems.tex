\section{Mean Value Theorem}

\begin{callout}
  We take the following theorem to be given (as the proof has been
  \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtKZo1qOVlQ}{provided}).
  \begin{theorem}[Mean Value Theorem]
  \label{thm:mean-value-theorem}
    Suppose that $f : [a, b] \to \R$ is differentiable. Then there exists a point $c \in (a, b)$ such that
    \[
      f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}.
    \]
  \end{theorem}
\end{callout}

\begin{callout}
  The first several problems for this unit were applications of \thmref{thm:mean-value-theorem} with multiple choice
  answers and are omitted here.
\end{callout}

\begin{problem}
  Prove that if $f'(x) \geq M$ for all $x \in [a, b]$, then $f(b) \geq f(a) + M(b - a)$.

  \begin{proof}
    We will prove the contrapositive. Start by assuming that
    \[
      f(b) < f(a) + M(b - a),
    \]
    which gives
    \[
      \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} < M.
    \]
    By \thmref{thm:mean-value-theorem}, there exists some $c \in (a, b)$ such that
    \[
      f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} < M.
    \]
  \end{proof}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Let $f$ be differentiable on $(a, b)$ and suppose $f'(x) \geq m > 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$.
  Prove that $f$ is strictly increasing on $[a, b]$.

  \begin{proof}

    By definition, $f$ is strictly increasing over $[a, b]$ if and only if $f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2})$ where $x_{1}, x_{2} \in [a, b]$ and $x_{1} < x_{2}$.
    Let $x_{1} < x_{2}$ be arbitrary. Then, by \thmref{thm:mean-value-theorem}, there exists some $c \in (x_{1}, x_{2}$ such that
    \[
      f'(c) = \frac{f(x_{2}) - f(x_{1})}{x_{2} - x_{1}} \geq m > 0,
    \]
    which gives $f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2}) > x_{2} - x_{1} > 0$ and, consequently, $f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2})$. 
  \end{proof}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  A fixed point of a function $f$ is a value $x$ where $f(x) = x$. Show that if
  $f$ is differentiable on a an interval with $f'(x) \neq 1$, then $f$ can have
  at most one fixed point.

  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
