\section{Two Hard Theorems (Part 2)}


\begin{callout}
  We take the following theorem to be given (as the proof has been \href{https://youtu.be/39ntUHbmXpc}{provided}).
  \begin{theorem}[Extreme Value Theorem]
  \label{thm:extreme-value-theorem}
    Suppose that $f : [a, b] \to \R$ is continuous. Then there exist points $c, d \in [a, b]$ such that
    \[
      f(c) \leq f(x) \leq f(d)
    \]
    for all $x \in [a, b]$. In other words, $f$ attains its minimum value at $c$ and its maximum value at $d$.
  \end{theorem}
\end{callout}

\begin{problem}
  Give a counterexample to \thmref{thm:extreme-value-theorem} on the open
  interval $(a, b)$ and on the unbounded domain $\R$. 

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Show that if $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ with $f(x) > 0$ for all $a \leq x \leq b$,
  then $\dfrac{1}{f}$ is bounded on $[a,b]$. 

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  In the video, we showed the ``maximum'' statement of \thmref{thm:extreme-value-theorem}. From thsi maximum statement, deduce the ``minimum'' statement
  (i.e., if $f : [a,b] \to \R$ is continuous, then $f$ attains a minimum value). 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Which part (or parts) of the proof of \thmref{thm:extreme-value-theorem} fails for open intervals $(a, b)$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Which part (or parts) of the proof of \thmref{thm:extreme-value-theorem} fails for unbounded intervals? 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Let $f : [a, b] \to \R$ be continuous and fix a point $y \in \R$. Show that there exists $m \geq 0$ such that
  $\abs{f(x) - y} \geq m$ for all $x \in [a, b]$.

  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
\end{problem}
