\section{Continuity}

\begin{problem}
  Assume $f(x) \geq g(x)$ for all $x \in \R$ and $f$ and $g$ are continuous
  everywhere. Show that for any point $c$ we must have $\lim\limits_{x \to c}
  f(x) \geq \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)$.

  \begin{proof}
    Let $c$ be arbitrary. By continuity of $f$ and $g$ at $c$, we know that 
    \[
      \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c), \qquad \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c).
    \] 
    Since $f(x) \geq g(x)$ for all $x \in \R$, it follows that 
    \[
      f(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) \geq \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c).
    \]
  \end{proof}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Show that the composition of continuous functions is continuous.

  \begin{proof}
    Let $f : \R \to \R$ and $g : \R \to \R$ be continuous. We will show that
    $f \circ g$ is continuous everywhere.

    Let $\eps > 0$ be given. By continuity of $f$, we know that for our given $\eps$,
    there exists some $\delta' > 0$ such that
    \[
      \forall x \in \R.\, \abs{g(x) - g(c)} < \delta' \implies \abs{f(g(x)) - f(g(c))} < \eps.
    \]
    Using a satisfying $\delta'$, we see, by continuity of $g$, that there
    exists $\delta > 0$ such that
    \[
      \forall x \in \R.\, \abs{x - c} < \delta \implies \abs{g(x) - g(c)} < \delta'.
    \]
    Taken together, we have
    \[
      \forall x \in \R.\, \abs{x - c} < \delta \implies \abs{f(g(x)) - f(g(c))} < \eps.
    \]
    Hence, $f \circ g$ is continuous at $c$, which was arbitrary, so $f \circ
    g$ is continuous everywhere.
  \end{proof}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  If $f$ is continuous at $c$ and $f(c) > 0$, show that there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $f(x) > 0$ for all
  $x$ satisfying $\abs{x - c} < \delta$ (i.e., if $f(c) > 0$, there is a region around $c$ where $f$ is greater than $0$).

  \begin{proof}
    Set $\eps = \dfrac{f(c)}{2} > 0$. By continuity of $f$ at $c$, we can obtain a $\delta > 0$ such that
    \[
      \forall x \in \R.\, \abs{x - c} < \delta \implies \abs{f(x) - f(c)} < \eps.
    \]
    Therefore, for all $x \in \R$ where $\abs{x - c} < \delta$, we have obtained a positive lower bound for $f(x)$:
    \[
      \abs{f(x) - f(c)} < \eps \implies f(c) - \eps < f(x) \implies \frac{f(c)}{2} < f(x).
    \]
  \end{proof}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Let $g : A \to \R$ and assume that $f$ is a bounded function on $A \subseteq \R$ 
  (i.e., there exists $M > 0$ satisfying $\abs{f(x)} \leq M$ for all $x \in A$).
  Show that if $\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x) = 0$, then $\lim\limits_{x \to
  c} g(x)f(x) = 0$ as well.

  \begin{proof}
    Let $\eps > 0$ be given. We want to show that there exists a $\delta > 0$
    such that if $0 < \abs{x - c} < \delta$ and $x \in A$, then $\abs{g(x)f(x)} < \eps$.

    Since $f$ is bounded on $A$, there exists a constant $M > 0$ such that
    $\abs{f(x)} \leq M$ for all $x \in A$. Because $g(x) \to 0$ as $x \to c$,
    by the definition of the limit, there exists a $\delta' > 0$ such that
    \[
      \forall x \in A.\, 0 < \abs{x - c} < \delta' \implies \abs{g(x)} < \frac{\eps}{M}.
    \]
    Now, consider $\abs{g(x)f(x)}$. For any $x \in A$ such that $0 < \abs{x - c} < \delta'$ we have
    \[
      \abs{g(x)f(x)} = \abs{g(x)} \abs{f(x)} \leq \abs{g(x)} M.
    \]
    Since $\abs{g(x)} < \dfrac{\eps}{M}$ when $0 < \abs{x - c} < \delta'$ for all $x \in A$,
    it follows that
    \[
      \abs{g(x)f(x)} < \left( \frac{\eps}{M} \right) M = \eps.
    \]

    Therefore, for $\delta = \delta'$, if $0 < \abs{x - c} < \delta$ and $x \in A$, 
    then $\abs{g(x)f(x)} < \eps$. Having found a satisfying $\delta = \delta' > 0$,
    we conclude that $g$ is continuous at $c = 0$.
  \end{proof}

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Let $g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$.
  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Prove that $g$ is continuous at $c = 0$.
      
      \begin{proof}
        To show $g$ is continuous at $c = 0$ it is sufficient to show that $\lim\limits_{x \to 0} g(x) = g(0) = 0$.

        Let $\eps > 0$ be given. We must demonstrate that there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
        \[
          \forall x \in \R.\, \abs{x} < \delta \implies \abs{\sqrt[3]{x}} < \eps.
        \].

        Set $\delta = \eps^{3}$. Then, for all $x \in \R$, we have
        \[
          \abs{x} < \delta \implies \sqrt[3]{\abs{x}} < \sqrt[3]{\eps^{3}}  \implies \abs{\sqrt[3]{x}} < \eps.
        \]
      \end{proof}

    \item Prove that $g$ is continuous at a point $c \neq 0$.

      \begin{proof}
        To show $g$ is continuous at any $c \neq 0$ it is sufficient to show that $\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c)$.

        First, let $c \neq 0$ and let $\eps > 0$ be given. We must demonstrate that there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
        \[
          \forall x \in \R.\, \abs{x - c} < \delta \implies \abs{\sqrt[3]{x} - \sqrt[3]{c}} < \eps.
        \].

      \end{proof}

  \end{enumerate}
