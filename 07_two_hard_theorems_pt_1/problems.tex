\section{Two Hard Theorems (Part 1)}

\begin{problem}
  Is there a continuous function $f : \R \to \R$ where $f(\R) = \Q$? What about $f(\R) = \Z$?

  \vspace{\baselineskip}

  No.

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Show the following more general consequence of the IVT:

  Suppose $f: \R \to \R$ is continuous, and $f(a) < f(b)$ for some $a < b$. Let
  $u \in (f(a), f(b))$ be a real number. Then there exists a real number $c \in
  (a, b)$ such that $f(c) = u$.

  \begin{proof} 
    See proof of \thmref{thm:intermediate-value-theorem}.
  \end{proof} 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Let $f : \R \to \R$ be continuous. Suppose that $f([0, 1])$ is contained in $[0, 1]$. Prove that 
  $f$ must have a fixed point; that is, show thaat $f(x) = x$ for at least one value of $x \in [0, 1]$.

  \begin{proof}
    Suppose to the contrary that $\forall x \in [0, 1].\, f(x) \neq x$.

    It cannot be the case that $f(x) > x$ for all $x \in [0, 1]$ because $f(1)
    \leq 1$. Similarly, $f(x) < x$ is not possible because $f(0) \geq 0$.
    Therefore, without loss of generality, there exists $x_{1} < x_{2}$ such
    that $f(x_{1}) \geq x_{1}$ and $f(x_{2}) \leq x_{2}$. Under our assumption,
    we have
    \[
      f(x_{1}) > x_{1}, \qquad f(x_{2}) < x_{2}.
    \]
    Let $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Then, by \thmref{thm:intermediate-value-theorem},
    \[
      \exists x' \in [x_{1}, x_{2}].\, g(x') = 0 \implies f(x') = x'.
    \]
    Having reached a contradiction, we have shown that $f$ must have a fixed point.
  \end{proof}
\end{problem}
